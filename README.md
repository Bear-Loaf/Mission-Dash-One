## Details
This repository serves as an off-site backup, proof of compliance with the game jam rules (see [Game Jam](itch.io/jams/one-shot-showdown)) and to make it possible for the judges to check for malicious code before executing the submitted binary.

If the judges don't trust my binary they can easily build it themselves from this repository by importing it as an project into Unity 6 or newer.
